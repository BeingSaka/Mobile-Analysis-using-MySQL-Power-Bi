# Mobile Analysis using MySQL & PowerBI
This project focuses on analyzing mobile datasets using MySQL for data storage and PowerBI for visualizations. The aim is to gain insights into various aspects of mobile products, helping businesses make data-driven decisions. The interactive visualizations explore key metrics such as sales trends, product features, and customer preferences.

# Key Features:
  * Data Insights: Analyze mobile product sales, specifications, and performance metrics.
  * Sales Trends: Examine the trend of mobile sales over time, identifying peak periods and consumer preferences.
  * Product Analysis: Understand different product features, pricing, and customer satisfaction scores.
  * Customer Behavior: Segment customers based on their purchasing patterns and demographic data.
  * Interactive Dashboards: Utilize PowerBI to visualize data through dynamic charts, graphs, and maps.
